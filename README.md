### Project Description

Created a cross-platform mobile application using React Native and Amazon Web Service. The app assists users in trying to recycle better by analysing pictures and detecting labels in order to provide additional information on how to recycle an item. 

### Built With

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?p=ft&z=subnav&loc=1&refid=2d3e6bee-b4a1-42e0-8600-6f2bb4fcb10c&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all/)
* [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)
